    - paragraph: The GSA centers of excellence were created in 2018 with the goal of implementing industry best practices in the federal government. They were created by a team of very experienced individuals in government technology and organizational maturation processes, but they were created without any funding for support functions. They were ASAF funded***. That created an ad-hoc approach to organizational processes, program management, and financial tracking. Over the years, the centers collected complex organizational debt in the field of process standardization, record keeping, and risk management. When I assumed the role of Executive Director **enter month and year here** I was faced with a highly capable team with subject matter experts, each doing their best to perform outside of any structural performance matrices.
    - paragraph: When I established my strategic goals, in the beginning of my tenure, I included organizational maturation as one of the five guiding stars that I set for the organization. I then enacted three tactical efforts. first was establishing an engagement management team responsible for establishing customer service standards, project management approach, and impact measurements for each of our 28 on-going projects. The second, was to establish a risk management group. This group was tasked with analyzing, and pursuant to the GAO green book, we initiated an organization wide risk assessment, then proceeded to evaluate existing controls and identify missing controls, and then build out our communications and implementation plans for each of the controls after identifying the control owner team member. These two efforts were then added to the third strategic effort, which was building a control management team which monitored the execution of which on of the SOPs,and quality of service delivered to our customers
    - paragraph: At the end of my tenure, the COE functions with a set of internal processes and procedures, implemented VI problem management framework, creating easy access to data straightforward continuous reporting across the GAO organization. Our quality of service and organizational resiliency increased while the team handled attrition of some of our most senior staff. During my tenure, a team comprised of 23 individual contributors executed on agreements valued at over 0 million dollars, over X number of agencies, across the federal government.
    - paragraph: Spearheaded an organization-wide initiative to create data-driven performance metrics using a standard set of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) for all Center of Excellence (CoE) projects with partner agencies. These metrics enabled us to measure our progress, demonstrate our impact, and communicate the value to stakeholders throughout the federal government.

    - paragraph: In 2020*, Congress tasked the Center for Disease Control with predicting the next pandemic. This charge, together with CDC’s ongoing data modernization efforts *look for how much funding* brought CDC to the Centers of Excellence. However, the CDC’s internal information architecture and data access modules were not mature enough to handle that task. While working with the CDC, CIO, and *her team*, I concluded that the CDC was well positioned to utilize our team services to allow for the required infrastructure maturation to support the machine learning and predictive analytics needs, that this new mission required
    - paragraph: CDC’s information technology infrastructure spent data centers around the world utilizing legacy technology, some of it beyond 60 years old, and relied on a dedicated team of IT professionals to maintain its current operations. The team did not have the capacity or the expertise needed to meet this new congressional mandate, or their statutory obligations to ensure public access to the raw materials and outcomes of public funded research. CDC has established it’s Data Exchange (DEX) program as part of its data modernization initiatives in 2019. As CDC progressed through its BMI road map, it identified the need for supporting infrastructure modernization to achieve their strategic initiative goals. 
    - paragraph: After interactions with multiple stakeholders in the CDC, CIO team, I guided my staff to establish three core efforts we would lead in support CDC’s missions. The first, was the CDC DEX-Ops implementation. I worked with CDC’s senior leadership and technical staff, to identify organizational challenges that must be met for CDC to achieve the level of maturity required. I led the team building and enterprise road-map, designed to identify current needs, find the correct mitigations and set three work-steams in process in to allow for the required organizational maturation.
    - paragraph: In this work-stream, my team worked with CDC staff to build an enterprise wide development security and operation model (DevSecOps) that encompassed the entirety of CDC’s infrastructure operations network. The implementation of this industry operational standard, allowed CDC to lay the foundation for the automation processes required to handle big data within its DEX. The second work stream worked within the my team and I assisted the CDC in building the initial implementation of the data exchange program. This allowed a unified standard API that opened access to “data sources” available to the public and other institutions. The third, and most complex, was an enterprise-wide change management and innovation adoption process. This process allowed CDC to scale its work force to build support with this new infrastructure and my team has departed.
    - paragraph: Proactively partnered inside General Services Administration with the Information Technology Category and Assisted Acquisition Services to deliver Cloud re-engineering solutions for CDC and Enterprize IT Operation and Modernization solutions to USDA, totaling over 800 million dollars

    - paragraph: USDA is tasked with supporting farmers and other producers across the United States by providing them with government managed farm operations and improvement loans. The USDA has a long documented history of affording these loans to specific populations of producers. As part of the implementation of the American Rescue plans initiated after the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020**, the USDA was tasked with distributing over three billion dollars to historically disadvantaged farmers. The systems containing the data needed to identify this farmer, an the mechanism to issue this debt forgiveness, was based on legacy infrastructure that as over 40 years old. Utilizing the current tools and manual efforts required, the USDA would have taken over six month to identify the impacted producers and initiate the process of statory required loan forgiveness. This would have violated the timeliness required by the American Rescue Plan Act Farm Loan Forgiveness Program.
    - paragraph: Working closely with the senior adviser for digital services to the secretary of agriculture, I established a consensus across GSA and USDA leadership, wherein, USDA would allow me to establish an **emergency task force** that was able to extract, analyze, and deliver the necessary information to the farm loans team within two weeks. By establishing this report between the two agencies, I created the opportunity to create a long-term XX** million dollars effort with USDA and the Deputy Undersecretary for Farm production, To facilitate continuous development after my team has left, we also established adoption of modern software development and service delivery standards. 
    - paragraph: At the end of a two-year engagement, USDA was well on its way in implementing a modernization road-map that would lead farm loans and rural development services off legacy infrastructure into utilizing modern solutions and methodology. Additionally, we facilitated the establishment of the USDA customer experience document and Cloud adoption Center of Excellence, both who support USDA’s on-going innovation and IT modernization efforts.
